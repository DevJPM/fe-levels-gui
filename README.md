# Fe-Level-GUI

This is the repository holding a GUI to predict and analyze Fire Emblem Level-Ups using a web-based locally computed GUI.

## To-Do

- Support for Probability Assisted Combat Previews, so for example to see how well a 20/15 Hector does against a chapter 30 enemy using an actual combat preview and then allowing for different RNG luck values
- Support for starting levels that are not 1
- Real support for more than GBA-Fire Emblem
- Research into how exactly each game handles level-ups (and how they try to avoid blank level-ups)
- Analytical support for the games / mechanics that can be analytically supported
- Monte-Carlo based support for games / mechanics that can't be
