# Fe-Level-GUI

This is the repository holding a GUI to predict and analyze Fire Emblem Level-Ups using a web-based locally computed GUI.

## To-Do

- Support for arbitrary, game-relevant character progressions (and not just 5 straight unboosted levels)
- Support for starting levels that are not 1
- Support for saving, loading, exporting and importing basic characters and their progressions
- Real support for more than GBA-Fire Emblem
- Research into how exactly each game handles level-ups (and how they try to avoid blank level-ups)
- Analytical support for the games / mechanics that can be analytically supported
- Monte-Carlo based support for games / mechanics that can't be
